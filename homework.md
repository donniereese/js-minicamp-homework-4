* Callback Functions
    When we talk about functions, we are talking about saved instructions that we can use over
    and over.  A Callback Function is another function, or another set of instructions, that we
    can include in a function.  If you are making a cake, it may say something like "and use your
    favorite icing recipe..."  When we follow our icing recipe, we are giving the result of our icing
    recipe, the icing, and using it in our cake recipe.  Your cake recipe is the recipe you would be
    refering to, or calling back to 'callback' when you are done with your icing recipe instructions!
* Closure

* `arguments`
    `arguments` are the list of things that you give to a function when you use it.  In a cake recipe,
    you would have to give all of your ingredients, add-ins and quantities to when you start your
    cake recipe.  With a function, the `arguments` are information that our instructions in a function
    need when it starts.
* Recursion
    Recursion is when a function or group of code has to call itself.  If you find yourself needing
    to use the same instructions in your function on something else, instead of repeating yourself
    over and over, you could just use your function again.  When making a cake, you might have a cake 
    recipe.  Well, your recipe might give you the measurements for each layer of a cake and say "repeat
    these instructions for every layer you want add."  The recipe wouldn't repeat itself, it would just
    refer to the original recipe.

* `prototype`
    `prototype` is like the original of the original.  Code and the functions that come with it can be
    copied.  If you copy something and modify it, then it's different.  If you want to modify something,
    but it's so important that all of the different copies need what you are doing, then you could give
    it a `prototype` function.  That gives it to the original and the original that everything is
    copied from makes sure every version of it already has it. Every copy always has the `prototype`
    functions that come with the original, even if it's a copy of a copy of a copy.
* Constructors
    Constructors are fancy functions.  It's like making a blueprint for something.  When you copy
    that function, the **constructor**, it does some setup. It cleans house, makes sure all of the
    functions and properties that it has are setup and can even take arguments and set things based
    on what you give it.  You can use a Constructor to make multiple versions of something that all
    have special functions and properties of their own.

# 2. Fork and clone this repo. When you need to commit use the following commands
    * `git status`
    * `git add-all`
    * `git status`
    * `git commit -m "your commit message#
    * `git push origin master`

    **Done!**

# 3. Install dependencies using `npm install`. Run tests using `npm test`.
    **Done!**

# 4. Make the tests pass!
    **Done!**
